      <p>The Botanical Garden of Bucharest was established as an institution in 1860, in addition to the Faculty of Medicine
         and Pharmacy, by Dr. Carol Davila. The founding decree was signed by Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza on November 5.
         At that time, the Botanical Garden occupied a relatively small area (7 ha) and was located on the left side of
         Cotroceni Road. The adequate arrangement of this space, as a didactic and research base, was carried out under
         the leadership of the skilled botanist Ulrich Hoffmann, as the first director of this institution.</p>

               <p>In 1874 the Botanical Garden was moved from the old location in the city center, on the grounds of the Vasile Şuţu Palace located in front of the University. In the same year, the institution became part of the University of Bucharest, operating under the Faculty of Sciences and headed by the remarkable professor Dr. Dimitrie Brandza. Improper conditions for the development of a botanical garden determined the great botanist to take many steps to obtain a suitable land for the redevelopment of this institution, in accordance with the mission he had to fulfill. In 1884 his actions were crowned with success, being allocated based on decree no. 659 of February 28 the necessary land and funds.</p>
